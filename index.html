<p>See! Next time you drink some nice boba tea, be sure to thank boba trees for their sacrifice.</p>
<h1>But how do they make boba?</h1>
<p>Maybe the tree gets put into a cup and then blended into boba?</p>
<p>What if the tree grows boba?</p>
<p>What if i get free Boba from this website?</p>
<p>(hopfully thats true)</p>

<h2> Now that I look at it...</h2>
<p>Is that matcha instead? It would make more sense than trees...</p>
<p>What is matcha made of?</p>
